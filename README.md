## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Run drush make. 
2. Unfortunately there is no documentation at the moment, so you will need to read the source code
to add custom PHP classes to enable content sharing across sites.
3. See [Flatfish](https://github.com/drupalstaffing/flatfish) for instructions on prepping your legacy HTML for Trekk to import.
4. Follow regular Drupal implementation practices.
