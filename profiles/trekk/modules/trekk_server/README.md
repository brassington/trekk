Trekk(er) server module provides a few handy alterations to Services 3 resourcesto make sharing content a little more robust. 
1. Output more than a few basic node fields.
2. Flatten out field arrays so we don't push forward all of the [und][0][value] stuff.
3. Use views to generate markup. (Note, this needs to be revised to NOT use Services 3's targeted actions.)
